# sunset-alert
This is a program that will cause the lights in my house to blink yellow before sunset. 1 hour, 30 minutes, and 15 minutes before sunset, any specified light source running WLED will blink yellow for about 30 seconds, letting you know that sunset is coming up, in case you want to walk outside to watch it.
